\title{Fetches a \code{GeneSetDb} from geneset collections defined in MSigDB.}
\usage{
getMSigGeneSetDb(
  collection = NULL,
  species = "human",
  id.type = c("ensembl", "entrez", "symbol"),
  with.kegg = FALSE,
  allow_multimap = TRUE,
  min_ortho_sources = 2,
  promote_subcategory_to_collection = FALSE,
  prefix_collection = FALSE,
  version = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{collection}{character vector specifying the collections you want
(c1, c2, ..., c7, h). By default we load just the hallmark collecitons.
Setting this to \code{NULL} loads all collections. Alternative you can also
include named subsets of collections, like \code{"reactome"}. Refer to the
Details section for more information.}

\item{species}{human or mouse?}

\item{with.kegg}{The Broad distributes the latest versions of the KEGG
genesets as part of the c2 collection. These genesets come with a
restricted license, so by default we do not return them as part of the
GeneSetDb. To include the KEGG gene sets when asking for the c2
collection, set this flag to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{allow_multimap, min_ortho_sources}{configure how to handle orthology
mapping (allow multimappers, and what type of level of db suport required).
See help in \code{\link[msigdb.data:msigdb_retrieve]{msigdb.data::msigdb_retrieve()}}}

\item{version}{the version of the MSigDB database to use.}
}
\value{
a \code{GeneSetDb} object
}
\description{
This provides versioned genesets from gene set collections defined in
\href{http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb}{MSigDB}. Collections can
be retrieved by their collection name, ie \code{c("H", "C2", "C7")}.
}
\section{KEGG Gene Sets}{

Due to the licensing restrictions over the KEGG collections, they are not
returned from this function unless they are explicitly asked for. You can
ask for them through this function by either (i) querying for the \code{"c2"}
collection while setting \code{with.kegg = TRUE}; or (ii) explicitly calling with
\code{collection = "kegg"}.
}

\section{MSigDB Versions}{

We recently switched to using the msigdbr package as the source of truth for
these, so v7 is the earliest version of the MSigDB collections we make
available. Version 6 are available in the following (deprecated) packages:
\itemize{
\item https://github.com/lianos/GeneSetDb.MSigDB.Mmusculus.v61
\item https://github.com/lianos/GeneSetDb.MSigDB.Hsapiens.v61
}
}

\section{Citing the Molecular Signatures Database}{

To cite your use of the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), please
reference Subramanian, Tamayo, et al. (2005, PNAS 102, 15545-15550) and one
or more of the following as appropriate:
\itemize{
\item Liberzon, et al. (2011, Bionformatics);
\item Liberzon, et al. (2015, Cell Systems); and
\item The source for the gene set as listed on the gene set page.
