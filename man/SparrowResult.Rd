\title{A SparrowResult object holds the results from a sparrow::seas() call.}
\description{
A call to \code{\link[=seas]{seas()}} will produce analyses for an
arbitrary number of GSEA methods, the results of which will be stored and
accessible here using the \code{\link[=result]{result()}}, \code{\link[=results]{results()}}, and \code{\link[=resultNames]{resultNames()}}.

In addition, the \code{\link[=GeneSetDb]{GeneSetDb()}} used for the analysis is accessible
via \link[=GeneSetDb]{geneSetDb()}, and the results from the differential
expression analysis is available via \code{\link[=logFC]{logFC()}}.

Visualizing results of a geneset based analysis also are functions that
operate over a \code{SparrowResult} object, for instance see the
\code{\link[=iplot]{iplot()}} and \code{\link[sparrow.shiny:explore]{sparrow.shiny::explore()}} functions.

feature measured in the experiment.}
