CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.x
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

  o `use.treat` parameter has been added to relevant places to run the internal
    differential testing via the "treat" framework made available in limma and
    edgeR via the `treat` and `glmTreat` "pipelines," respectively.

  o goseq, fry, and romer testing methods have been added.

  o Use of `hyperGeometricTest` strongly discouraged now that goseq is here,
    set `really.use.hyperGeometricTest=TRUE` if you're really stubborn.

  o Support for DGEList expression input fully baked in. Previously, a DGEList
    was shot through voom to be used internally. Internal differential gene
    expression statistics on DGELists use edgeR's quasi-likelihood framework.
    See `?edgeR::glmQLFit` for more information, and particulary reference
    Aaron Lun's tutorial on using this approach here:

      It's DE-licious: a recipe for differential expression analyses of RNA-seq
      experiments using quasi-likelihood methods in edgeR
      http://www.statsci.org/smyth/pubs/QLedgeRPreprint.pdf

  o Adds support for PANTHER pathway (and GOSLIM) genesets from PANTHER.db
    package via the `getPantherGeneSetDb` function.

  o Added geneSetFeatureStats to return the logFC (and membership) information
    for a geneset after a multiGSEA run.

  o Added constructors and `as()` coercion functions to create GeneSetDb's
    from GeneSetCollection(s) and data.frames (and vice versa).

  o `scoreSingleSamples` is another wrapper function which calls several single
    sample geneset scoring algorithms, including the ones provided by the
    GSVA package (such as plage and ssGSEA)

  o Adds expression-utils.R for CPM/RPKM and meltx. Also has methods to
    facilitate "universal access" to pData, fData, and expression data from
    the different often-used expression containers
    (ExpressionSet, EList, DGEList, SummarizedExperiment)

  o MSigDB definitions were updated to v5.0, which adds a new "hallmark (h)"
    gene set. A call to `getMSigDBset` without a version parameter will return
    the v5.0 data.

    Note that MSigDB provides the entrez IDs for each geneset as human genes.
    The mouse version of these gene sets was constructing by mapping the
    human entrez ID's to their mouse orthologs via `igis::orthologs`. When
    this mapping returns multiple mouse IDs for a single human ID, all of
    the mouse IDs are kept in the mouse geneset.

    To get the previous v4.0 genesets (provided by WEHI), you would simply
    specify version='v4.0' in the getMSigDBSet like so:

      gdb5 <- getMSigDBsetc(c('c2', 'c7'), species='mouse')
      gdb4 <- getMSigDBsetc(c('c2', 'c7'), species='mouse', version='v4.0')

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Changed geneSetFeatureStatistics to geneSetsStats

  o Internal differential expression testing defaults to `use.treat=TRUE`

BUG FIXES

  o do.hyperGeometricTest was failing when the expression object `x` was a
    matrix.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1
----------------------

NEW FEATURES

  o `multiGSEA` returns a `MultiGSEAResult` object which holds all of the things
    one would need to analyze/plot/poke at the results of the function call.

  o Plotting functions added so user can plot results of arbitrary genesets.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o This version is a reboots the internals of this package so that its design
    is cleaner. All of the reporting bits were removed (rmd.plugins handles that
    now), as well as significant additions to the API of this packages.  The
    changes are too numerous to report here. The previous version before the
    refactor have been put here for posterity:
