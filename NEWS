CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

  o MSigDB definitions were updated to v5.0, which adds a new "hallmark (h)"
    gene set. A call to `getMSigDBset` without a version parameter will return
    the v5.0 data.

    WARNING: the mouse orthologue mapping has not been done yet in v0.2.0, but
    will be done in the near feature. Currently if you want to get mouse
    MSigDB signatures, you can get them like so:

      gdb <- getMSigDBset(c('c2', 'c7'), species='mouse', version='v4.0')
