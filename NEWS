Changes in version 0.99.0 (2021-09-29)
* Submission to Bioconductor
* Breaking changes from pre-release:
  - First two parameters in ora() function have been swapped so that the
    first parameter (`x`) is the object (data.frame) to run an over
    representation analysis against, and the second parameter is the GeneSetDb.
  - scoreSingleSamples no longer drops features in `y` that are not found
    in the GeneSetDb used for scoring. This was changed so that gsva and ssGSEA
    scores match the scores produced by a normal GSVA::gsva call. You can set
    the `drop.unconformed = TRUE` to retain the older behavior.
